            In 1886 the Māori King Tāwhiao established a bank,
            Te Peeke o Aotearoa, which was in business until around 1905.
            It was set up to provide banking and monetary services to Māori
            and was also an expression of Māori autonomy.

            This £1 note is held by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is
            one of the few to survive until the present day.
